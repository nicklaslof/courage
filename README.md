JS13k 2024 Theme: Triskaidekaphobia

A game for JS13k 2024 by [Nicklas Löf](https://mastodon.social/@snukey)


The whole game is written in ES6 Javascript using TinySprite for WebGL rendering.

I made the graphics in Aseprite and compressed them with TinyPNG and Compress-or-die.

The sound effects was created in the exellent ZzFX web application and using ZzFX library to play them.

Minification done with rollup and terser.

Black magic compression done with Roadroller.

And finally additional zip compression done with ect.


I have no build system, just using a simple compile shellscript.

The game is (C) Nicklas Löf 2024 and can't be distributed anywhere else than at js13kgames website https://js13kgames.com.
