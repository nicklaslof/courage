ideas:

    Dungeon game
        13 different rooms/dungeons themed to 13 different fears.

        2D: Heroes of loot like battle.  Arcade:ish battles with high tempo.
            Draw pixels myself or use TinyGL this year again?
                Yes, the performance will suffer alot
            Can I do the alpha blending like lights myself without WebGL?

            I might want to draw pixels myself since I might need "lots" of graphic

        3D: Like Searching for 04 but bigger rooms, fast paced battles, movements, jumping...

        Randomized rooms? From templates put together.
